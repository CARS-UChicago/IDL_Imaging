 NAME:
       EPICS_AD_DISPLAY

 PURPOSE:
       This procedure is a general purpose routine to display EPICS arrays as
       images.
       It uses either the built-in IDL routine TV for simple image display, or our routine IMAGE_DISPLAY to perform interactive pan, 
       zoom and scroll, live update of row and column profiles, etc.

 CATEGORY:
       Imaging

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       EPICS_AD_DISPLAY, ImagePV

 INPUTS:
       ImagePV:  The base name of an areaDetector NDStdArrays object that contains the image data.  This name is the
                 $(P)$(R) values passed to NDStdArrays.template when the EPICS database is loaded.  This database
                 contains not only the image data itself, but also PVs that contain the image dimensions, etc.

 PROCEDURE:
       This procedure simply create a new object of class EPICS_AD_DISPLAY.
       See the documentation for EPICS_AD_DISPLAY for more information.

 PREBUILT VERSION:
       In addition to the source code version of these files, the file epics_ad_display.sav
       is included in the distribution tar file.  This file can be run for free 
       (no IDL license needed) with the IDL Virtual Machine.

 IMPORTANT NOTES:
       The environment variable EZCA_IDL_SHARE must be set to point to the complete path
       to the shareable library ezcaIDL.so (Linux, Unix, and Mac) or ezcaIDL.dll (Windows).
       Note that the ezcaIDL shareable library or DLL must be built with EPICS R3.14 or later
       in order to use arrays larger than 16000 bytes.

       The environment variable EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES must be set to at least the number
       of bytes in the the image data array.

 EXAMPLE:
       IDL> epics_ad_display, 'GSE-PILATUS1:Image1:'

 NAME:
       EPICS_AD_DISPLAY::INIT

 PURPOSE:
       The EPICS_IMAGE_DISPLAY class provides a general purpose routine to display
       EPICS arrays as images. It uses either TV for simple but fast display,
       or <A HREF=#IMAGE_DISPLAY>IMAGE_DISPLAY</A> to perform interactive pan,
       zoom and scroll, live update of row and column profiles, etc.

       This function initializes an object of class EPICS_AD_DISPLAY.  It is
       not called directly, but is called indirectly when a new object of
       class EPICS_IMAGE_DISPLAY is created via OBJ_NEW('EPICS_IMAGE_DISPLAY')

       The EPICS_AD_DISPLAY object creates simple GUI display which provides
       widgets to control the EPICS PV to display, the number of rows and columns in
       the images, inverting in the Y direction, enable/disable, and a status display.

       EPICS_AD_DISPLAY waits new data for the EPICS array, and then displays the
       new image.

 CATEGORY:
       Imaging

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       obj = OBJ_NEW('EPICS_AD_DISPLAY', ImagePV)

 INPUTS:
       ImagePV:  The base name of an areaDetector NDStdArrays object that contains the image data.  This name is the
                 $(P)$(R) values passed to NDStdArrays.template when the EPICS database is loaded.  This database
                 contains not only the image data itself, but also PVs that contain the image dimensions, etc.

       In order to display images that contain more than 16000 bytes (which most images do!)
       it is necessary that both the EPICS server (e.g. IOC) and the EPICS client
       (i.e. ezcaIDL.so or ezcaIDL.dll) be built with EPICS 3.14 or later.
       Furthermore, one must set the environment variable EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES to be
       at least the size of the image array data.  This must be done on both the client and
       server machines.
       For example, with the Pilatus detector we typically set EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES=500000.

 OUTPUTS:
       This function returns 1 to indicate that the object was successfully
       created.

 REQUIREMENTS:
       This function requires <A HREF=#IMAGE_DISPLAY>IMAGE_DISPLAY__DEFINE.PRO</A>,
       GET_FONT_NAME.PRO, and <A HREF=ezcaIDLGuide.html>ezcaIDL</A>.
       EZCA_IDL requires the shareable library (ezcaIDL.so or ezcaIDL.dll) that
       contains the functions used to communicate with EPICS.

 EXAMPLE:
       IDL> obj = OBJ_NEW('EPICS_IMAGE_DISPLAY', 'GSE-PILATUS1:ImageData', nx=487, ny=195)

 NAME:
       IMAGE_DISPLAY

 PURPOSE:
       This procedure is a general purpose image display routine.
       It allows interactive pan, zoom and scroll, live update of row and
       column profiles, etc.

 CATEGORY:
       Imaging

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       IMAGE_DISPLAY, Data, Object_ref

 INPUTS:
       Data:   A 2-D array to be displayed

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
       This procedure simply passes all keywords to IMAGE_DISPLAY::INIT by

       for IMAGE_DISPLAY::INIT for more information.

 OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
       Object_ref:  
           The object reference for the resulting IMAGE_DISPLAY object.  This
           is useful for controlling the IMAGE_DISPLAY object from other
           routines.

 PROCEDURE:
       This procedure simply create a new object of class IMAGE_DISPLAY.
       See the documentation for the IMAGE_DISPLAY class library for more information.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       Written by:     Mark Rivers (3-DEC-1998)
       3-APR-1999  MLR  Fixed so that it will reform input array if it is
                        greater than 2-D but with some dimensions=1,
                        e.g. Data = intarr(100,1,100), which happens
                        frequently when extracting slices from 3-D data
       23-SEP-1999 MN   Added code to write JPEG file
       12-APR-2001 MLR  Added cleanup code so that the image_display object and all
                        pointers are free when the user closes the window.
       11-JUN-2001 MN   Added dropdown menu for output types (JPEG, BMP, PNG), and
                        added 'title' and 'subtitle' keywords which are
                        displayed in the window title
       17-JAN-2001 MLR  Delete line that called "a2f".  Line did nothing and a2f
                        is not needed.
       27-APR-2002 MLR  Added order keywords to write_jpeg and write_png so images
                        are correct side up.
                        Fixed bug in plotting vertical column profile if self.image_window.order=1, thanks
                        to Peter Vontobel of Swiss Light Source.

       4-JUN-2002  MLR  Added "title" keyword to image_display::display_image
                        and "leave_mouse" keyword to other routines.  These
                        changes allow tomo_display:: to scroll though 2-D
                        slices in a 3-D volume quickly and easily.

       27-APR-2006  MLR Added "tiff" output option

       21-NOV-2007  MLR Added order keyword and order widget, no longer use !order except at startup
                        Added RETAIN keyword to SCALE_IMAGE, to preserve zoom, center and intensity
                        scaling.
                        Added autoscale widget for automatically scaling display range.

 NAME:
       image_display::SCALE_IMAGE

 PURPOSE:
       This routine displays a new image in an existing image_display object.

 CATEGORY:
       Imaging

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       image_data->SCALE_IMAGE, Data

 INPUTS:
       Data:   A 2-D array to be displayed

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
       XDIST:  An array containing the user units ("distance") of the
               X axis pixels.  Dimensions must be same as xsize of Data.

       YDIST:  An array containing the user units ("distance") of the
               Y axis pixels.  Dimensions must be same as ysize of Data.

       MIN:    The minimum display intensity.  Default=min(Data).

       MAX:    The maximum display intensity.  Default=max(Data).

       ZOOM:   A scaler or 2-element (X,Y) array of integer zoom factors.
               Default = 1 in each direction.  ZOOM=2 will zoom 2X in both
               directions, ZOOM=[1,2] will zoom 1X in X, 2X in Y.

       CENTER: The location where the center of the image should be located
               in the display window.
               The default is the center of the display window.
               CENTER=[200,300] will center the image at X=200, Y=300

       NOERASE: Set this flag to not erase the window before displaying the
               image.  Allows multiple images to share a window.

       INTERPOLATE:  Zoom the image by interpolation rather than replication.

       REPLICATE: Zoom the image by replication rather than interpolation.

       TITLE:  The title to give the display window.

       SUBTITLE:  The subtitle to give the display window.

       ORDER:  The order in which to display the image.
               0=bottom to top
               1=top to bottom
               Default = Existing order

       LEAVE_MOUSE:  Set this keyword to not move the mouse to the center of the
               new image display.

       RETAIN: Set this keyword to not reset the zoom and intensity scaling when
               when the new data are displayed.  This requires that the dimensions
               of the image be the same as the image currently displayed.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
       Written by:     Mark Rivers (3-DEC-1998)
       20-Nov-2007  MLR  Added ORDER and RETAIN keywords.

 NAME:
   MAKE_MOVIE

 PURPOSE:
   This procedure plays a 3-D array as a movie either:
       - On the screen
       - To an MPEG file on disk (deprecated)
       - To an MP4 file on disk
       - To a series of JPEG files on disk
       - To a series of TIFF files on disk

 CATEGORY:
   Image display.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   MAKE_MOVIE, Volume

 INPUTS:
   Volume: A 3-D array of any numeric data type.  This input is ignored if the FILE
           keyword is used.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
   FILE:
       The name of a file to be used as input, rather than passing the Volume array.
       This file is read with READ_TOMO_VOLUME().
   BUFFER_SIZE:
       When reading a large file from disk with the FILE keyword, this keyword
       controls the size of the memory buffer used for reading the file.  If the size
       of the file is larger than the buffer size then the file is read in "chunks".
       This allows displaying files larger than the physical or virtual memory of
       the system would otherwise permit.  The units are voxels, not bytes.
       The default is to read the entire file.
   MIN:
       The minimum value of the data display range.  This sets the low end
       of the grey scale range.  All values less than this will be appear
       black when using a linear grey scale.  The default is the minimum value
       of the data in the entire Volume array.

   MAX:
       The maximum value of the data display range.  This sets the high end
       of the grey scale range.  All values greater than this will be appear
       white when using a linear grey scale.  The default is the maximum value
       of the data in the entire Volume array.

   SCALE:
       A scale factor to increase or decrease the size of the displayed images
       relative to the size of the Volume array.  SCALE=2 will double the
       size of the displayed images, SCALE=3 will display the images at 3
       times their normal size, etc.  SCALE=-2 will display the images at
       half their normal size, SCALE=-3 one-third their normal size, etc.
       The default is 1, i.e. no scaling.

   INDEX:
       This keyword controls which dimension of the Volume array is animated.
       Allowed values are 1, 2 and 3.  The following table shows the result
       of setting this keyword:

           INDEX   frame[i]
             1   Volume[i,*,*]
             2   Volume[*,i,*]
             3   Volume[*,*,i]
       The default is 3, i.e. the last dimension of the Volume array is the
       one which is animated.

   START:
       The first frame to display.  The default is 0.

   STOP:
       The last frame to display.  The default is the highest value of the
       selected index.

   STEP:
       The array increment from one frame to the next.  The default is 1.

   WAIT:
       The delay time from one frame to the next in floating point seconds.
       The default is 0., i.e. frames are diplayed as fast as possible.
       This keyword has no effect if the JPEG_FILE or MPEG_FILE keywords are used.

   WINDOW:
       The window number if the movie is being displayed on the screen.  The
       window will be created to be exactly the right size to display the movie.
       The default is 0.

   MPEG_FILE:
       The name of an MPEG file to which the output should be written.  If
       this keyword is used then this procedure does not display its output on
       the screen but rather creates an MPEG file.
       NOTE: IDL requires a special (free) license upgrade to write MPEG
       files.  See the IDL Web site for details.

   MP4_FILE:
       The name of an MP4 file to which the output should be written.  If
       this keyword is used then this procedure does not display its output on
       the screen but rather creates an MP4 file.
       MP4 files are written using the IDL WRITE_VIDEO procedure which was added
       in IDL 8.2.3.

   JPEG_FILE:
       The base name of an JPEG file to which the output should be written.  If
       this keyword is used then this procedure does not display its output on
       the screen but rather creates a series of JPEG files. A sequence number and
       the extension .jpg are appended to this base name. The file names are thus
       of the form 'my_jpeg_name_0001.jpg', 'my_jpeg_name_0002.jpg', etc.  The system
       variable !order is used to determine whether the files are written bottom to
       top or top to bottom.

   TIFF_FILE:
       The base name of an TIFF file to which the output should be written.  If
       this keyword is used then this procedure does not display its output on
       the screen but rather creates a series of TIFF files. A sequence number and
       the extension .tif are appended to this base name. The file names are thus
       of the form 'my_jpeg_name_0001.tif', 'my_jpeg_name_0002.tif', etc.  The system
       variable !order is used to determine whether the files are written bottom to
       top or top to bottom.
       
   UNSCALED_TIFF
       Set this flag to write unscaled TIFF files.
       If this flag is not set then the TIFF files are scaled to 8-bits using the MIN and MAX.
       If this flag is set then the TIFF files are unscaled, and their data type will be the same
       as the input VOL array, for example 16-bit signed integers.

   QUALITY:
       The quality factor for JPEG and MPEG files.
       See the help for WRITE_JPEG for more information on using this
       keyword for JPEG files.
       See the help for MPEG_OPEN for more information on using this
       keyword for MPEG files.  For MPEG files this keyword is only allowed
       for IDL 5.4 and higher.
       Default=90.
       
   FPS
       The Frames Per Second for MP4 files.  This is passed as the VIDEO_FPS keyword to WRITE_VIDEO.
       The default is 30.
       
   BPS
       The bits per second MP4 files.  This is passed as the BIT_RATE keyword to WRITE_VIDEO.
       This keyword controls the quality and size of the MP4 file.  Larger values (e.g. 1e6) produce
       larger files with higher quality, while smaller values (e.g. 1e4) produce smaller files with lower
       quality.
       Default=1e4. For typical 16-bit tomography data this produces a file which is about 0.7% of the size of the original
       with reasonably good quality.  BPS=1e5 produces a file that is about 7% of the original size with excellent quality.

   COLOR
       A flag which indicates that the JPEG, MPEG, or MP4 output files should be in color,
       using the current color table, rather than black and white.

   LABEL:
       A flag which indicates that the current frame number should be drawn
       as a label on the screen.  This is useful for determining which frames
       interesting features appear in, for use later with IMAGE_DISPLAY
       or other routines.

   STATUS_WIDGET:
       The widget ID of a text widget used to display the status of the
       preprocessing operation.  If this is a valid widget ID then
       informational messages will be written to this widget.

   ABORT_WIDGET
       The widget ID of a widget used to abort the preprocessing operation.
       If this is a valid widget ID then the "uvalue" of this widget will be
       checked periodically.  If it is 1 then this routine will clean up and
       return immediately.

 OUTPUTS:
   This procedure does not return any output to IDL.  It displays images on
   the screen using the IDL TV procedure, or writes output to disk if JPEG_FILE, MPEG_FILE
   or MP4_FILE is used.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
   Displays images on the screen using the IDL TV procedure, or writes output
   to disk if JPEG_FILE, JPEG_FILE, or MP4_FILE is used.

 PROCEDURE:
   This procedure converts each frame to an 8-bit array using the IDL BYTSCL
   function and then either displays it on the screen using the TV procedure,
   writes it to an MPEG file, an MP4 file, or to a series of JPEG or TIFF files.

 EXAMPLE:
   ; Display an array as a movie scanning through the first dimension of the
   ; array, forcing the black level to be 1000, and waiting 0.2 seconds
   ; between frames
   MAKE_MOVIE, Volume, index=1, wait=.2, min=1000

   ; Create an MPEG movie of an array scanning through the last dimension
   ; (default) of the array, forcing the white level to be 10000.
   MAKE_MOVIE, Volume, max=10000, mpeg_file='movie1.mpeg'

   ; Create a series of JPEG files of an array scanning through the last dimension
   ; (default) of the array, forcing the white level to be 10000.
   MAKE_MOVIE, Volume, max=10000, jpeg_file='my_jpegs'

   ; Create a series of JPEG files of disk file scanning through the first dimension
   ; of the array, forcing the white level to be 5000.  Set a buffer size of
   ; 200,000,000 voxels (400MB for 16 bit data)
   MAKE_MOVIE, file='my_volume.dat', max=5000, index=1, jpeg_file='my_volume_X', $
                     buffer_size=2e8

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
   Written by:     Mark Rivers, April 26, 1999.  Merged previous routines
                   TOMO_MOVIE and WRITE_MPEG
   June 27, 2000  MLR  Changed position of label slightly for legibility
   Sep. 29, 2000  MLR  Added JPEG_FILE and QUALITY keywords.
   Feb. 27, 2001  MLR  Added COLOR keyword for color JPEG and MPEG files.
                       Made QUALITY keyword apply to MPEG files if the IDL version
                       is 5.4 or higher.
   Nov. 5, 2001   MLR  Added the FILE and BUFFER_SIZE keywords.
   Nov. 22, 2001  MLR  Added the ABORT_WIDGET and STATUS_WIDGET keywords
   Nov. 24, 2001  MLR  Added the WINDOW keyword
   Apr. 26, 2002  MLR  Worked around bug in MPEG_PUT, movies were upside down relative
                       to on-screen and JPEG files.
   Jan. 9,  2004  MLR  Added TIFF_FILE keyword
   Nov. 30, 2004  MLR  Put MPEG and JPEG output through lookup table if COLOR=0.

 NAME:
   VOLUME_RENDER

 PURPOSE:
   This procedure is a general purpose GUI-based volume rendering routine.
   It allows setting of cutting planes, color and opacity tables, etc.

 CATEGORY:
   Imaging

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
   VOLUME_RENDER, Data

 INPUTS:
   Data:   A 3-D BYTE array to be displayed

 PROCEDURE:
   This procedure is a GUI front-end for the IDLgrVolume object.
   See the documentation on IDLgrVOLUME for more information.

 RESTRICTIONS:
   This procedure is a work in progress, and additional features will be added
   as time permits.  In particular a better opacity table editor is needed.

 EXAMPLE:
       IDL> a = bingen(200, 200, 200)
       IDL> volume_render, a

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
   Written by:     Mark Rivers (12-MAR-1999)
                   This procedure was based on the d_volrendr.pro from the
                   IDL demos, generalized and with additional features
